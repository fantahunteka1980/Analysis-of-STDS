# Analysis-of-STDS

Executive Summary

Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) Infection rates(2010-2019)
Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are very common. Millions of new infections are detected every year in the United States. The objective of this analysis is to create awareness on how the disease is spreading nationwide by taking a dataset from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Surveillance Reports 2010-2019 and other sources as necessary to come up with some critical recommendations. 
Motivation

The reason I chose to work on this project: -  
I start learning Science since grade seven. Since then, I had a passion for Biology, Chemistry and Physics classes. I took a number of biology classes while I was doing my undergraduate and graduate program along with my major mathematics classes. I got the chance to work on some health-related datasets while I was doing my graduate course works. Now, after I join NSS, I worked on some health dataset and created some visualizations on Power BI and Tableau which sparked my interest to do more detailed health data analysis now and so forth. 

Data Question

1, How is the disease is progressing throughout the years from 2010 through 2019?
2, Which state is afected more than the other?
3, What group of etnicities and race are afected by the disease more?
4, What are the top ten counties affected by STD?
5, Which gender is affected more by STD?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP for this Capstone Project would be to deliver a detailed analysis report and an executive summary on how the Sexually transmitted disease is spreading nationwide and see what part of the country is affected more than the others.
  
Schedule 

1.	Get the Data (May 15)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (June 15)
3.	Create Presentation of your Analysis (June 19)
-	Should be a presentation, but could include a Jupyter Notebook or dashboard in Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI
4.	Internal demos (June 26)
5.	Demo Day!! (June 29)

Data Sources

The primary source would be STDs Nationally Ranked by State summary dataset from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Surveillance Reports 2000-2016. Other data sources would be used as needed to support the analysis.

Known Issues and Challenges

The dataset has 851 records and more columns. The plan is to compress some of the columns and concentrate on the focused groups (columns). Once the data cleaning is done, the data will be loaded to SQL and Select Statements would be used to manipulate the focused columns, do the analysis work and use visualization tools to present the findings.
